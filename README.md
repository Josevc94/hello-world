# hello-world
First repository.
Hey World ! I am Jos√© Vieytes from Argentina. I am a passionate about new technologies. 
I started developing in April 2017. My goal is to be some day a Game Developer. 
UPDATE: At 11/08/2021 I would just add that the goal had changed to become a Full Stack Developer, but I'm still learning code and being passionate about new technologies.
